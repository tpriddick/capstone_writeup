# Introduction
In the ever dynamic finance world, traditional methods of analyzing stock market movements are being supplemented by approaches that leverage the vast amount of data available on the internet. One such approach is the analysis of social media sentiment to predict stock market trends. This project aims to utilize the social media posts, specifically those on the X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit platforms, to gain insights into public sentiment and its potential impact on stock prices.

Social media platforms have become significant discourse centers where individuals express their opinions, sentiments, and reactions to various events, including financial markets. The volume of data generated on these platforms provide a unique opportunity to capture real-time public sentiment. By analyzing tweets and correlating them with historical financial data from Yahoo Finance, this project seeks to develop a predictive model that can offer insights into stock market movements.

The project involves several key steps:

Data Collection: Gathering financial data from Yahoo Finance and social media data from X and Reddit posts related to specific stock entities.

Sentiment Analysis: Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of the collected tweets, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral, and aggregating each day's sentiment into a single score.

Data Integration: Connecting the aggregated sentiment scores with historical stock prices to identify patterns and relationships.

Predictive Modeling: Developing machine learning models to predict future stock price movements based on the analyzed sentiment data.

Evaluation and Validation: Testing the model's accuracy and reliability using historical data and refining it to improve performance.

By integrating social media sentiment with traditional financial analysis, this project aims to provide a more comprehensive and timely understanding of stock market dynamics. The outcome could potentially aid investors and financial analysts in making more informed decisions, leveraging the collective sentiment expressed on social media as an additional indicator of market trends.
