# Background

The financial markets have always been influenced by public sentiment, with news, rumors, and opinions shaping the decisions of investors and traders. Traditionally, analysts relied on financial statements, market indicators, and economic reports to gauge market trends. However, the internet and social media have transformed the landscape, providing a new dimension of real-time data. Platforms like Twitter/X and Reddit have become influential platforms where people share their views on market conditions and specific stocks, as well as their views on the companies themselves. 

The concept of using social media sentiment as a predictive tool for financial markets has gained traction in recent years, supported by growth in natural language processing (NLP) in machine learning. Studies have shown that there could be a significant correlation between social media sentiment and stock market movements, making it a valuable resource for predicting short-term market trends [@financialtimes]. This project builds on this emerging field by developing a model that leverages social media sentiment to forecast stock price movements, providing a modern approach to financial analysis.

We chose four stock entities to focus our analysis on: GameStop (GME), Wingstop (WING), Nvidia (NVDA), and Dogecoin (DOGE). GameStop was selected due to it's short-squeeze in January 2021 which was driven by Reddit. Wingstop and Nvidia were chosen because of their recent growth, which has caused them to become popular topics on social media. Finally, Dogecoin was primarily propelled by social media, as well as endorsements by influential figures such as Elon Musk. This list may seem small compared to the wealth of stock entities, but this is intentional. The primary reason was that we wanted to ensure we were able to collect sufficient social media data given limited resources, as we discuss in the Methods section. Additionally, analysis of how well social media sentiment influences the stock market movement of these entities, if proven consequential, would provide us reason to pursue further research into other entities.
